We have referred and adapted the code for the baseline model from https://bastings.github.io/annotated_encoder_decoder/ (Baseline folder)

Each other folder (apart from Baseline) contains a variant architecture introduced by us

Training.ipynb contains common training code for all the variants

utils.py contains Helper functions used by all the variants

Please copy Training.py and utils.py to the folder of the intented variant before running the code

Please download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews and move to folder of intented variant
